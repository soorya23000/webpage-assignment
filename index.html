     <p>Princess Diana was Princess of Wales while married to Prince Charles.
        One of the most adored members of the British royal family, she died in a 1997 car crash.
        Diana, Princess of Wales, was the first wife of Prince Charles, the future king of the United Kingdom, 
        and was the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry. Born Diana Frances Spencer, she became Lady Diana Spencer 
        after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975.
        She married Charles on July 29, 1981, and after a largely unhappy union under constant scrutiny from the media,
        they divorced in 1996. Diana died on August 31, 1997, from injuries she sustained in a car crash in Paris.
        She is remembered as the “People’s Princess” because of her widespread popularity and global humanitarian efforts.
