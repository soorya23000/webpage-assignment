    <h2>Public Role</h2>
    
<p>
After her marriage, The Princess of Wales quickly became involved in the official duties of the Royal Family.
Her first tour with The Prince of Wales was a three-day visit to Wales in October 1981.
In 1983 she accompanied the Prince on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, and they took the infant Prince William with them.
 Prince William, with Prince Harry, again joined The Prince and Princess of Wales at the end of their tour to Italy in 1985. 
Other official overseas visits undertaken with the Prince included Australia (for the bicentenary celebrations in 1988), Brazil, India,
Canada, Nigeria, Cameroon, Indonesia, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal and Japan (for the enthronement of Emperor Akihito).
Their last joint overseas visit was to South Korea in 1992. 
The Princess's first official visit overseas on her own was in September 1982, when she represented The Queen at the State funeral of
Princess Grace of Monaco. The Princess's first solo overseas tour was in February 1984, when she travelled to Norway to attend a 
performance of Carmen by the London City Ballet, of which she was Patron. The Princess subsequently visited many countries including
Germany, the United States, Pakistan, Switzerland, Hungary, Egypt, Belgium, France, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nepal. 
Although the Princess was renowned for her style and was closely associated with the fashion world, patronising and raising the profile
of younger British designers, she was best known for her charitable work.</p>
